A gogoanime autodownloader made using pyautogui


An ultra-simple project. Basically it's a set of mouse-movements and click events. 

So, pyautogui has a moveTo function, which sets the cursor to a give location. Then I used the click event. Whenever an advertisement tab opens up, it will close it automatically using the hotkey function (ctrl + w).

Simple set of steps:

Step 1 : Click the download button.

Step 2 : Select the correct option

Step 3 : Close the ad tab

A new tab opens up with an advertisement. pyautogui just hotkeys ctrl + w to close it.

Step 4 : Scroll down and click next episode
